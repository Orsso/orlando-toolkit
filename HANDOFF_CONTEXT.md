# Orlando Toolkit Plugin Architecture - Project Handoff Context

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Tasks 1-5 Completed, Tasks 6-10 Pending  
**Branch**: `plugin-architecture-dev`

## Project Overview

Orlando Toolkit is being transformed from a monolithic DOCX-to-DITA converter into a plugin-driven DITA reader and structure editor. The plugin system enables extraction of format-specific conversion logic into separate plugins while maintaining a clean, extensible core architecture.

**Core Transformation**: DOCX conversion logic → First plugin, Core app → DITA-only reader with plugin support

## Source of Truth Documents

**CRITICAL**: These documents define the complete architectural specification and must be followed exactly:

1. **`plugin-architecture-design.md`** - Complete technical design specification
2. **`plugin-architecture-implementation-tasks.md`** - Detailed task breakdown and implementation guide

## Architectural Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### KISS, DRY, YAGNI Compliance
- **KISS**: Simple, straightforward implementations only
- **DRY**: Reuse existing patterns and infrastructure
- **YAGNI**: Implement ONLY features specified in design documents

### Design Boundaries
- **Plugin Scope**: Pipeline plugins ONLY (document conversion to DITA)
- **No Tab Extensions**: Future enhancement, out of current scope
- **No Over-Engineering**: Trust-based security, simple GitHub integration
- **Exact Design Match**: Follow design documents precisely

### Quality Standards
- Type hints for all interfaces and public methods
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Integration with existing logging and configuration patterns
- Robust error boundaries preventing plugin failures from crashing app

**Key Requirements**:
- Create AppContext class for plugin-core integration
- Modify service constructors for dependency injection
- Create service factories using plugin implementations
- Service lifecycle management for plugin activation/deactivation

### Task 7: Implement DITA-Only Core Application Functionality  
**Objective**: Transform core application to work as DITA-only reader when no plugins installed.

**Key Requirements**:
- Create DitaPackageImporter for zipped DITA archives (.zip)
- Update application flow for DITA archives as primary input
- Ensure all core functionality works with DITA-only input
- Add fallback behavior when no conversion plugins available

### Task 8: Isolate DOCX-Specific Code for Future Plugin Extraction
**Objective**: Identify and isolate all DOCX-specific code components for clean extraction.

**Key Requirements**:
- Create comprehensive inventory of DOCX-specific components
- Add clear markers for plugin extraction boundaries
- Isolate DOCX dependencies in requirements.txt
- Create mapping documentation for code movement
- Ensure isolation doesn't break existing functionality

### Task 9: Implement UI Extension Points and Right Panel Plugin Integration
**Objective**: Enhance RightPanelCoordinator to support plugin-provided panels.

**Key Requirements**:
- Extend RightPanelCoordinator for plugin panel support
- Create UIRegistry for plugin UI component registration
- Plugin panel factory system with lifecycle management
- Integration with existing preview/filter panels

### Task 10: Integration Testing and Validation Framework
**Objective**: Create comprehensive tests validating plugin system functionality.

**Key Requirements**:
- Integration test suite for plugin system
- Mock plugins for testing
- Performance tests for plugin loading impact
- Error handling validation
- UI integration testing

## Critical Integration Points

### Plugin System Architecture
```
orlando_toolkit/core/plugins/
├── __init__.py           # Public API exports
├── base.py              # BasePlugin abstract class
├── loader.py            # PluginLoader - discovery and lifecycle
├── registry.py          # ServiceRegistry - handler registration
├── manager.py           # PluginManager - installation/removal  
├── downloader.py        # GitHubPluginDownloader
├── installer.py         # PluginInstaller with dependencies
├── metadata.py          # Plugin metadata validation
└── exceptions.py        # Plugin-specific exceptions
```

### Service Integration Patterns
- ConversionService uses ServiceRegistry to find DocumentHandlers
- PluginManager integrates with PluginLoader for discovery
- Error boundaries prevent plugin failures from crashing core app
- Existing service patterns maintained for backward compatibility

### UI Integration Points
- Splash screen uses PluginManager to get active plugins
- Plugin management dialog uses PluginManager for all operations
- Icon loading system with fallbacks for missing assets
- Modal dialogs follow established Tkinter patterns

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Dependencies
```bash
# Core dependencies (already in requirements.txt)
lxml
python-docx  # Will be moved to DOCX plugin
Pillow
sv-ttk
pyyaml
tkinterweb>=3.13
requests  # Added for GitHub integration

# Development dependencies

```

### Plugin Directory Structure
```
~/.orlando_toolkit/
├── plugins/
│   ├── docx-converter/          # Future DOCX plugin
│   └── [other-plugins]/
└── plugin-configs/
    └── [plugin-name].yml        # Plugin-specific configs
```

## Testing and Validation

### Validation Framework
Each task includes specific validation criteria that must be verified:
- Component functionality tests
- Integration tests with existing systems  
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Design document compliance verification

### Critical Success Metrics
- Plugin system loads and manages plugins without crashes
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition
- UI integration seamless with existing patterns
- All design document requirements implemented exactly

## Code Quality Standards

### Required Patterns
- Type hints for all public interfaces
- Comprehensive docstrings following existing patterns
- Error handling with detailed, actionable messages
- Integration with existing logging system
- Consistent naming conventions with current codebase

### Architecture Compliance
- No undiscussed architectural changes
- Follow existing service layer patterns
- Maintain separation of concerns (UI/Service/Core layers)
- Plugin isolation with proper error boundaries

## Handoff Instructions for Next Operator

### Immediate Context
- **Current State**: Plugin system foundation complete (Tasks 1-5)
- **Next Focus**: Service layer abstraction and DITA-only core (Tasks 6-7)
- **Critical Dependencies**: All plugin infrastructure ready for integration

### Essential Reading Order
1. Read `plugin-architecture-design.md` completely
2. Review `plugin-architecture-implementation-tasks.md` for remaining tasks
3. Examine completed implementations in `orlando_toolkit/core/plugins/`
4. Review current `orlando_toolkit/app.py` for UI integration patterns

### Key Success Factors
- **Design Document Adherence**: Follow specifications exactly, no deviations
- **YAGNI Compliance**: Implement only specified features, no extras
- **Integration Focus**: Build on existing infrastructure, don't recreate
- **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error boundaries throughout

### Critical Attention Points
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing DOCX functionality
- Ensure plugin failures never crash main application
- Follow established UI patterns from Tasks 4-5
- Integrate with completed plugin management infrastructure

### Validation Approach
- Test each task against its specific validation criteria
- Verify integration with all previous tasks
- Ensure design document compliance at each step
- Validate error handling and edge cases

## Emergency Escalation

If architectural questions arise or ambiguities in design documents are discovered, escalate immediately rather than making assumptions. The plugin architecture transformation requires precise implementation to ensure clean extraction of DOCX logic into plugin format.

**Contact Point**: Original project stakeholder for architectural clarification
**Documentation**: All decisions and clarifications should be documented in implementation reports
