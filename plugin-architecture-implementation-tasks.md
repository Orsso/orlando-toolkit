# Orlando Toolkit Plugin Architecture Implementation Tasks

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Estimated Timeline**: 10-14 weeks  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive task list for scaffolding the Orlando Toolkit plugin architecture transformation. The goal is to prepare the codebase to extract the existing DOCX-to-DITA conversion logic into a plugin while establishing the foundational plugin system.

**Scope**: Pipeline plugins only (document conversion to DITA archives)  
**Architecture Reference**: `plugin-architecture-design.md`

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Sequencing
Tasks are organized in dependency order and should be implemented sequentially within each phase:

**Phase 1 - Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Tasks 1-3  
**Phase 2 - User Interface** (Weeks 5-7): Tasks 4-5  
**Phase 3 - Integration** (Weeks 8-11): Tasks 6-8  
**Phase 4 - Finalization** (Weeks 12-14): Tasks 9-10

### Success Metrics
After completion, the codebase should achieve:
- [ ] Application starts and functions without any plugins installed
- [ ] Plugin system can load, validate, and register pipeline plugins
- [ ] Splash screen shows squared buttons including dynamic plugin buttons  
- [ ] Plugin management UI allows GitHub repository import
- [ ] Service layer is abstracted to work with plugin-provided DocumentHandlers
- [ ] DOCX-specific code is identified and isolated (but not yet extracted)
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work during transition

### Critical Architectural Requirements
1. **Plugin Categories**: Only "pipeline" plugins that convert formats to DITA
2. **Service Registry**: DocumentHandler registration and resolution
3. **Splash Screen**: Squared buttons with icons, plugin buttons added dynamically
4. **Plugin Management**: Modal dialog with GitHub URL import capability
5. **DITA-Only Core**: Application works without plugins, only opens .zip DITA archives
6. **Plugin Metadata**: JSON-based plugin.json with specific schema
7. **Dependency Management**: Plugins manage dependencies via requirements.txt
8. **GitHub Distribution**: Download and install plugins from repositories

### Quality Assurance
Each task must include:
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Input validation and security checks
- Documentation for future maintenance
- Integration with existing code patterns

---

**Final State**: A codebase ready to receive the DOCX-to-DITA conversion logic as a plugin while maintaining all existing functionality and providing a clean, extensible plugin architecture for future format support.
