# Image naming configuration
# Controls how extracted images are renamed during export
# Users can override these settings in ~/.orlando_toolkit/image_naming.yml

# Prefix for all image filenames
prefix: "IMG"

# Naming pattern with tokens:
#   {prefix} - The prefix value above
#   {manual_code} - Manual code from metadata
#   {section} - Section number (e.g., "1", "2-1", "3-2-1")
#   {-index} - Image index within section (only added when multiple images)
#   {ext} - Original file extension
pattern: "{prefix}-{manual_code}-{section}{-index}{ext}"

# Starting number for image indices within each section
index_start: 1

# Zero-padding for image indices (0 = no padding, 2 = "01", "02", etc.)
index_zero_pad: 0
